# Mleco - set of econometrics' tools

That's probably not that useful library in production term, however
I find that set of functions pretty helpful in solving *econometric* exercises.

## TODO

- place helpers functions like `handler` or `report_calculations` in another module
- more documentation within function definitions?
- fix tests
- add implementation for PCC for more than one explanatory variable
- do we need matrices?
- enum for decisions in interpreting PCC
- combinations incorporation
