# Mleco - set of econometrics' tools

That's probably not that useful library in production term, however
I find that set of functions pretty helpful in solving *econometric* exercises.

## TODO

- implement Hellwig's method on calculating correlations
- implement matrices of R and R0 in pcc
- fix the imports (from mleco.py) in utils
- fix tests
- add implementation for PCC for more than one explanatory variable
- enum for decisions in interpreting PCC - gives us hardcoded decisions
- combinations incorporation

## Extra TODO
- I propose to add CI with tests and linting code -> good opportunity to learn CI e.g. gh workflows?
- create front-end to allow in-browser usage
- rework: make every function step-like and pass the vectors throught the pipelines of calculations
- more documentation within function definitions?
