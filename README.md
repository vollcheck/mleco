# Mleco - set of econometrics' tools

That's probably not that useful library in production terms, however
I find that set of functions pretty helpful in solving *econometrics* exercises.

## TODO

- could think of shorter names for functions
- place helpers functions like `handler` or `report_calculations` in another module
- more documentation within function definitions?
